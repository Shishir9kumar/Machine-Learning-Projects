So it's not a marvel film even on marvels worst day ie Thor 2 but this is solid enough. It's massively overhyped same as aquaman. I think everyone gets so carried away not being the normal DC trash they rate it a lot higher.

I am quite surprised it turned out aswell with all the bad ingredients

1- Director has pretty much only ever done shorts 2- the producers consist of The Rocks he she ex and her brother who spent the first 3 Rock films fetching coffee and you have Geoff Johns who's produced all the Dc tripe so far.

Despite this and the super suit and with padding and the trailer having all the best jokes it wasn't half bad
