What have they done to Captain Marvel he is not a fun character, he's fights crime, but they made him look like a Buffoon, l didn't even stay till the end very disappointed, my advice is watch the 1941 serial "The Adventures of Captain Marvel" with Tom Tyler as Capt. Marvel and Frank Coghlan Jr as Billy Batson, it had everything, a terrific villain called the Scorpion, dressed from head to toe in a black mask and coat covered in white scorpions, the story lie was excellent better than this rubbish l have just tried to watch, l would hasten to add that l was not alive in 1941 but l collect old Saturday kids Matinee serials and A.O.C.M was one of the best, special FX were by brothers Howard and Theodore Lydecker, superior in every way.
