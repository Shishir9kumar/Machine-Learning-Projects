At least, it was not completely boring. But if you seek more, nothing to find there. It's a kid movie that is too graphic for kids. After an Aquaman offering a new, original direction and memorable scene, a DC movie completely empty.

As a superhero movie, nothing new, nothing impressive and nothing beautiful. As a comedy, maybe a few laugh, although most jokes are simply references or unoriginal jokes. If you saw the trailers, don't expect anything more: all the jokes were there.

The actor playing Billy Batson is quite good and sympathetic but he somehow becomes more stupid and childish when he transforms: let's call him Hazam already, he obviously didn't catch the wisdom of Solomon.

The enemy doesn't improve the movie: nothing interesting and the movie contains random monsters that could be in movies from the year 2000.

It was already in production when Aquaman was released so hopefully, the shift will come after. The new trailer for the Joker prequel at least gives hope for that.
