This is terrible. Absolutely terrible. It's long, not funny (all the jokes in the trailers), and at the end amazingly boring.

It's take ages to present the characters, the main villain is awful and I prefer not talk about that sidekick kid Freddy, probably the most annoying character in theaters for the last decade. And my god the CGI!! The demons are ugly and badly designed.

This is so far the worst experience I had in a theatre. Don't waste you're time on this, this movie should have make it direct-to-DVD. Hopefully, this will be a massive flop Ã  the box office (not even 350M WW to my opinion)
