I don't know if the other reviewers saw the same movie I did. Feels to me like DC paid a bunch of folks to give them 10/10 before any real reviews would have a chance to show up.

This is a film for braindead America - it has no nuance, no "jokes" or plot lines that aren't explicitly explained (some multiple times), no genuine heart or even a single fully developed character. Everyone fits into their modern superhero film archetype. References are made to "hip memes" and being "woke." Brief but unmissable nods are made to the ideologyically possessed social justice crowd.

Watch this after watching any serious superhero movie from decades prior, even the not so great ones, and it becomes apparent how far we've fallen. This is a bastardization of the genre..... but sadly seems like it's here to stay.
