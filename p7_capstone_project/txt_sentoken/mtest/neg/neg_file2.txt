Yes, talking to about the same people who "under voted" CM. Here's a movie which deserves about a 5-5.5 rating with it's lack of any originally, a very annoying title character (yes, him being a 15 old doesn't change the fact that his dialogue would be a better fit for Kevin Hart than a superhero and yes, I mean that as an insult.) Huge stepback from Aquaman for DC. Bad CGI, a superhero with a very good impression of the early Keanu Reeves "acting range". (oh yes I went there...). The basic idea is good, so are most of the kid actors and Strong is OK in a bad role. That's 3 out of 10 for me. DC is always better with the darker movies anyways.
