Great, Really Great

This movie threw us in at the deep end and we swam with the fishes. It was a great ride that kept our attention from start to finish.

It was long, it was a monumental saga it was CGI gone mad, but this was a really great movie and delivered exactly what was on the tin.

Jason Momoa gets special mention, he gave a solid endearing performance that trod the line of humour, self-deprecation and super-hero

I loved it
