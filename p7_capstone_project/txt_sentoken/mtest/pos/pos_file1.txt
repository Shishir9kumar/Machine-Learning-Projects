Zachary Levi stars as a superhero incarnation in this above average superhero blockbuster about a teenage foster child in Philadelphia who discovers his calling as a bona fide superhero. Asher Angel is solid as the teenage superhero-to-be, but he is considerably upstaged by a Jack Dylan Grazer who gives a likeable performance as his aspiring sidekick. Mark Strong is menacing as the human vessel for the seven deadly sins.

Rousing and funny, this film is great entertainment although I do wonder how much a medium for children it truly is. It has many tense scenes of mayhem and the portrayal of the seven deadly sins might scare some children. The aspect of foster care is sympathetically portrayed here and adds to the film's genuineness.

The film does take a while to take shape, in keeping with the mindset of a teenage boy just beginning to discover his true potential, but its payoff is tremendous. It goes from decent to superior as it becomes a classic battle of good and evil. This is a welcome addition to the superhero genre. Gladly recommended.
