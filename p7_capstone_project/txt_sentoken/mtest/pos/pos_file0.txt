I always rate things but this is my first written review. Everyone should go watch it. Seriously you would have to be death inside to not enjoy this movie. Its funny and sad. Heartwarming but w enough of action, it's a superhero movie after all. Couple of things are probably scary for kids under 7. Unless your child is like my daughter, she didn't think it was scary at all. The twist were, well unexpected of course. Just go watch it!!
