I saw the trailer and I thought- genius a superhero that's actually a kid! Think, Tom Hanks' "Big" meets Superman (1978). I remember liking Shazam as a kid in the 80's (it took me a long time to call him Capt Marvel) but not much else I remember. So I watched the 1940's serial & was impressed, so I watched the 1970's tv show and although cheesy was entertaining, so I moved onto the 1980's filmation series and fell in love with that. This renaissance I had with Shazam only happened 5 months ago too! Shazam! (2019) has all that 40's/70's/80's elements mixed together. The bad guys look awesome, the movie has lots of laughs and tons of heart. One bad thing: there is 1 short scene (parent scene) that gets too dark - it made me feel uncomfortable...it kinda pulled me out of the movie but thank god it's a short scene cuz this is one of my favorite comic book movies ever. 1. Batman 1989 2. Dark Knight 3. Superman 2 4. CA Civil War 5. Shazam!
