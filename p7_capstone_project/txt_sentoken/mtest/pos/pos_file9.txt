Simply the best, better than all the rest

A more perfect cast couldn't have been put together for this movie. Amber Heard is the most beautiful creature on land or in the sea. Even with orange hair or wet hair she is so stunning that she eclipses all the action going on around her. Her character Mera is no damsel in distress either. So happy she finally has a worldwide audience for her legendary beauty. Jason Momoa is has the build and the hybrid looking eyes that comic book creators could only have dreamt of. Who else could be more suited to the role of Aquaman? There something a little tongue in cheek in his personality that helps too. The multi talented Patrick Wilson as evil brother shows how versatile he is jumping from other Wan movies like Conjuring to this superhero movie effortlessly. Nicole Kidman's towering height has finally been put to good use as queen of Atlantis.

The visuals are also beautiful beyond expectations. When there is too much in the sea there is some interesting surface action too. The satisfying and epic story has remains easy to follow from start to finish - Marvel movies could learn from DC here.

A standard bearer for the future of action hero movies.
