## Content: Introduction and Foundations
## Project: Titanic Survival Exploration

## Project Overview
Welcome to the project Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree!

## Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

If you already have Python 2.7 installed on your computer, then you can install `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` and Jupyter Notebook (formerly known as "iPython") by using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) on the command line. [This page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) may also be of use for some packages for Windows users, if pip has trouble performing the installation. After installing pip, you can install all the packages with the following command:

`sudo pip install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter`

## Starting the Project

For this assignment, you can find the `titanic_survival_exploration` folder containing the necessary project files on the [Machine Learning projects GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning), under the `projects` folder. You may download all of the files for projects we'll use in this Nanodegree program directly from this repo. Please make sure that you use the most recent version of project files when completing a project!

This project contains three files:

- `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `titanic_data.csv`: The project dataset. You?ll load this data in the notebook.
- `visuals.py`: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.
